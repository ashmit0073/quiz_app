### 🧪 Example Quiz Questions
What are the main building blocks of Flutter UIs?

How are Flutter UIs built?

What's the purpose of a StatefulWidget?

What happens if you change data in a StatelessWidget?

### 🔄 Restart Quiz Logic
We use setState() and a screen-swapping mechanism using StatefulWidget in main.dart to go back to the start screen when the "Restart Quiz" button is pressed.

### 🧩 How It Works
1. User taps "Start Quiz"

2. Question screen shows questions one-by-one

3. Each answer is saved to a List<String> called chosenAnswers

4. When quiz ends, result screen uses:
summaryData.where((data) => data['user_answer'] == data['correct_answer'])

To calculate score and display question-wise summary.
